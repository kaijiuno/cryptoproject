# cryptoproject

This is a github repository for the English 112 Unit 3 Project. The objective of this project is to develop an original cryptocurrency that designed to be (1) deflationary by nature and (2) environmentally cautious. 

(1) How Kunocoin (KUNO) is deflationary by nature:

Unlike many mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, Kunocoin is produced with a fixed supply of one billion tokens, and it will not increase its supply through the mining process ( mining is compensated with additional Binance tokens). Due to its fixed supply, Kunocoin is able to maintain its deflationary nature, allowing investors an opportunity to hedge against inflationary fiat currencies. 

(2) How Kunocoin (KUNO) is environmentally cautious:

Kunocoin is a token on top of the Binance Smart Chain. It is not built upon an original blockchain, so there is no need for a strong electrical infrastructure supporting KUNO, as it can simply use existing blockchain where mining is efficiently mananged. This greatly lowers the amount of energy consumption that KUNO requires to make transactions.
